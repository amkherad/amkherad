## Develop
In order to be able to contribute to this project, you have to follow these instructions:
* Keep things separate, this means, different projects may not need some dependecies that may be introduced by putting everything in a single project, so create new projects when necessary.
* UnitTests are important, so write enough tests.
* On each commit tests will run to ensure code quality.
